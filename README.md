SIMPLE CALCULATOR
A system which help you to count aritmethic problems

Technologies used : Devc++, VS Code, ChatGPT

Features : This system can count two operations, for example a+b or a-b or a/b or a*b.

Setup Interactions: Disclamer I can only code in c++, haven't mastered HTML,CSS and JS;
1. I create the algorithm of calculator
2. I used this prompt in ChatGPT to create the calculator layout "Create HTML with css tailwind a simple calculator layout with big soft pink rectangle one the back and the keypad consist of 1 2  4 5 6 7 8 9 0 and + - / * = the keypad is white with black text and also create rectangle for the input field i want it soft gray"
3. Then I used this prompt to convert my C++ to JS and connect it to the HTML and CSS "(calculator.cpp) convert this to JS and connect it to the html and css code"
4. And I make some adjusments because when I debug it, it wont delete previous answers when continue to the next arithmethic problems by this prompt "after show the result and clik on the number aggain automaticly delete before history so it wont continue again"

AI support explanation:
-Layout Designer: helped create the HTML and CSS (using Tailwind) for a simple calculator layout, based on my prompt describing a large soft pink background, a soft gray input field, and white keypad buttons with black text.
-Translator: converted my C++ calculator algorithm into JavaScript and connected it to the HTML and CSS code.
-Debugging Assistant: helped fix a bug where the calculator would not clear the previous result when starting a new calculation. After showing the result, clicking a number now automatically clears the old value.
